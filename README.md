# Neural Network Get Started in 30 Minutes
This tutorial is for people:
* Who have programming experience but not much mathematics knowledge. 
* Who hear Neural Network a lot but don't understand the terminologies in the back.
* Who understand basics of Python coding and environment setup.

It aims to help people understand Neural Network in 30 minutes so that they will be able to further do research or discuss with algorithm professionals. 

This tutorial will be seperated into 10 sessions, 3 minutes reading each. It covers following 3 topics:
* What is Neural Network
* How to use Neural Network
* How to create a Neural Network 

The tutorial includes both explanation of concepts and code for praticing. We believe people can understand better by praticing during learning. 
* Understand coding basics: Python and Numpy
* Where can I try Neural Network: TensorFlow Playground
* What is Neural Network: Introduction
* How does it solve a Non-linear problem: Activation Function
* Real business problem: Classification and Regression
* Train the Neural Network: Backpropogation
* Different types of Neural Network: CNN, RNN, LSTM
* Improve Accuracy: Regularization and Overfitting
* Improve Performance by tuning Model: Hyperparameter
* Improve Performance by adjusting input data: Preprocessing

The code is written in Python Jupyter Notebook. You can set up environment in your own computer to try the code. You can also access online IDE like [Trinket](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/create?lang=python3) or [Repl.it](https://repl.it) to practice.

We believe AI is the future and Neural Network can help us get started with this technology to make the world better. We welcome everyone to share feedbacks and contribute together! When participating, you not only understand more about Neural Network, but also learn about Git, Markdown, and Python.
