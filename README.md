# Deep Learning(Neural Network) in 30 Minutes
This tutorial is to help people understand Deep Learning(Neural Network) in 30 minutes so that they will be able to further research or discuss with algorithm professionals. 

This tutorial will be seperated into 10 sessions, 3 minutes reading each. It covers following 3 topics:
* What is Neural Network
* How to use Neural Network
* How to create a Neural Network 

The tutorial includes both explanation of concepts and code for praticing. We believe people can understand better by praticing during learning.
* Python Basics
* Pandas
* Numpy
* TensorFlow
* Forfeed Neural Network
* Backprop Neural Network
* Classification
* Regression
* Preprocessing

We believe AI is the future and Neural Network can help us get started with this technology to make the world better. We welcome everyone to share feedbacks and contribute together!
