You can play with TensorFlow Playground so that you can understand the core ideas behind neural networks. Then you can understand why people have become so excited by the technology as of late.\n",

Though how it impacts is different between machine learning architectures, it should be optimized to find its best value to achieve faster training process and more accurate result. Higher value give faster learning but it may cause the model to fail to converge. Lower value gives higher chance to converge but may cause the model to learn too slow and even stuck in a local minima/maxima.\n",
