    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is one of the variants of neural networks used heavily in the field of Computer Vision. It derives its name from the type of hidden layers it consists of. The hidden layers of a CNN typically consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, and normalization layers. Here it simply means that instead of using the normal activation functions defined above, convolution and pooling functions are used as activation functions.\n",

    "Pooling: Pooling is a sample-based discretization process. The objective is to down-sample an input representation (image, hidden-layer output matrix, etc.), reducing its dimensionality and allowing for assumptions to be made about features contained in the sub-regions binned.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 main types of pooling commonly known as max and min pooling. As the name suggests max pooling is based on picking up the maximum value from the selected region and min pooling is based on picking up the minimum value from the selected region.\n",
    "![image.png](images/cnn-pooling.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus as one can see A Convolutional Neural Network or CNN is basically a deep neural network which consists of hidden layers having convolution and pooling functions in addition to the activation function for introducing non-linearity."
