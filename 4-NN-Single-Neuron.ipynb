    "When a signal comes in, it gets multiplied by a weight value that is assigned to this particular input. That is, if a neuron has three inputs, then it has three weights that can be adjusted individually. The weights usually get adjusted during the learn phase.\n",
    "After this the modified input signals are summed up. It is also possible to add additionally a so-called bias b to this sum. The bias is a value which can also be adjusted during the learn phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the actual output has to be determined. For this purpose an activation or step function Φ is applied to weighted sum of the input values.\n",
